Introducing to Object-Oriented Programming by C++

- **CPP_00:** Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.
- **CPP_01:** Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement.
- **CPP_02:** Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form.
- **CPP_03:** Inheritance.
- **CPP_04:** Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces.
- **CPP_05:** Repetition and Exceptions.
- **CPP_06:** C++ casts:
    * Conversion of scalar types;
    * Serialization;
    * Identifying real type.
- **CPP_07:** Templates:
    * ***function templates***: this exercise is about writing 3 simple function templates: swap(), min() and max().
    * ***template for array iter***: this exercise is about writing a generic function to iterate through arrays.
    * ***class templates***: this exercise is about writing a class template that behaves like an array.
